        <li> 2 Medium-size pieces of Stockfish </li>
        <li> 2 Medium-size Smoked fish </li>
        <li> 5 pieces of Yellow scotch bonnet </li>
        <li> 10 Cups of thinly sliced Ugwu (Pumpkin leaves) </li>
        <li> 3 Cups of thinly sliced Water leaves </li>
        <li> 0.5kg of Assorted Meats </li>
        <li> 1 Maggi Cube/Crayfish </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Either Blend the yellow peppers or slice it, keep aside. </li>
        <li> Soak your smoked fish in hot water and clean to get rid of the dirts. Keep aside </li>
        <li> Wash your meats thoroughly and transfer into a cooking pot. Place the pot on a hob on low heat, add the Boullion cube(s) and salt to taste. Steam the meats for 15-20minutes, this is so the meats release their own juices. Do NOT add water but remember to check every now and then so they don’t burn. </li>
        <li> After 15 minutes, add 2 cups of water and the blended yellow Ata Rodo and cook on medium heat till tender… </li>
        <li> When the meats are half cooked, add the Stockfish and cook till the Stockfish softens up… </li>
        <li> When it’s soft, take out the stockfish and shed to smaller pieces, add back into the pot, also shred the smoked fish and add. Also the king prawns, cook for 3 minutes thereabouts.. </li>
        <li> After 3 minutes, by this time, the prawns should have cooked, add the palm oil. Stir and combine, let this cook for 5 minutes, this is so the palm oil is fully dissolved and well combined with the meats. </li>
        <li> Now, add the washed water leaves, combine thoroughly, turn the heat down to low, leave to combine for 3-5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Now add the crayfish, stir and combine, cook for a minute…. </li>
        <li> Now add the washed Ugu leaves…. </li>
        <li> Combine the Ugu thoroughly, taste the soup for salt/seasoning and adjust if necessary. You wouldn’t need much seasoning if your stock had been well seasoned from the start. Turn off the heat, then leave to simmer with the residual heat for 3 minutes. Be careful not to over cook your vegetables.
            And it’s done… </li>
    </ol>
